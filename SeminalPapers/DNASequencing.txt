ABSTRACT A new method for determining nucleotide sequences
in DNA is described. It is similar to the "plus and
minus" method [Sanger, F. & Coulson, A. R. (1975) J. Mol. Biol.
94,441-4481 but makes use of the 2',3'-dideoxy and arabinonucleoside
analogues of the normal deoxynucleoside triphosphates,
which act as specific chain-terminating inhibitors of DNA
polymerase. The technique has been applied to the DNA of
bacteriophage 4bX174 and is more rapid and more accurate than
either the plus or the minus method.
The "plus and minus" method (1) is a relatively rapid and
simple technique that has made possible the determination of
the sequence of the genome of bacteriophage 4X174 (2). It
depends on the use of DNA polymerase to transcribe specific
regions of the DNA under controlled conditions. Although the
method is considerably more rapid and simple than other
available techniques, neither the "plus" nor the "minus"
method is completely accurate, and in order to establish a sequence
both must be used together, and sometimes confirmatory
data are necessary. W. M. Barnes (J. Mol. Biol., in press)
has recently developed a third method, involving ribo-substitution,
which has certain advantages over the plus and minus
method, but this has not yet been extensively exploited.
Another rapid and simple method that depends on specific
chemical degradation of the DNA has recently been described
by Maxam and Gilbert (3), and this has also been used extensively
for DNA sequencing. It has the advantage over the plus
and minus method that it can be applied to double-stranded
DNA, but it requires a strand separation or equivalent fractionation
of each restriction enzyme fragment studied, which
makes it somewhat more laborious.
This paper describes a further method using DNA polymerase,
which makes use of inhibitors that terminate the newly
synthesized chains at specific residues.
Principle of the Method. Atkinson et al. (4) showed that the
inhibitory activity of 2',3'-dideoxythymidine triphosphate
(ddTTP) on DNA polymerase I depends on its being incorporated
into the growing oligonucleotide chain in the place of
thymidylic acid (dT). Because the ddT contains no 3'-hydroxyl
group, the chain cannot be extended further, so that termination
occurs specifically at positions where dT should be incorporated.
If a primer and template are incubated with DNA polymerase
in the presence of a mixture of ddTTP and dTTP, as well as the
other three deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (one of which
is labeled with 32p), a mixture of fragments all having the same
5' and with ddT residues at the 3' ends is obtained. When this
mixture is fractionated by electrophoresis on denaturing
acrylamide gels the pattern of bands shows the distribution of
dTs in the newly synthesized DNA. By using analogous terminators
for the other nucleotides in separate incubations and
running the samples in parallel on the gel, a pattern of bands
is obtained from which the sequence can be read off as in the
other rapid techniques mentioned above.
Two types of terminating triphosphates have been used-the
dideoxy derivatives and the arabinonucleosides. Arabinose is
5463
a stereoisomer of ribose in which the 3'-hydroxyl group is oriented
in trans position with respect to the 2'-hydroxyl group.
The arabinosyl (ara) nucleotides act as chain terminating inhibitors
of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I in a manner
comparable to ddT (4), although synthesized chains ending in
3' araC can be further extended by some mammalian DNA
polymerases (5). In order to obtain a suitable pattern of bands
from which an extensive sequence can be read it is necessary
to have a ratio of terminating triphosphate to normal triphosphate
such that only partial incorporation of the terminator
occurs. For the dideoxy derivatives this ratio is about 100, and
for the arabinosyl derivatives about 5000.
METHODS
Preparation of the Triphosphate Analogues. The preparation
of ddTTP has been described (6, 7), and the material is
now commercially available. ddA has been prepared by
McCarthy et al. (8). We essentially followed their procedure
and used the methods of Tener (9) and of Hoard and Ott (10)
to convert it to the triphosphate, which was then purified on
DEAE-Sephadex, using a 0.1-1.0 M gradient of triethylamine
carbonate at pH 8.4. The preparation of ddGTP and ddCTP
has not been described previously; however we applied the
same method as that used for ddATP and obtained solutions
having the requisite terminating activities. The yields were very
low and this can hardly be regarded as adequate chemical
characterization. However, there can be little doubt that the
activity was due to the dideoxy derivatives.
The starting material for the ddGTP was N-isobutyryl-5'-
O-monomethoxytrityldeoxyguanosine prepared by F. E.
Baralle (11). After tosylation of the 3'-OH group (12) the
compound was converted to the 2',3'-didehydro derivative with
sodium methoxide (8). The isobutyryl group was partly removed
during this treatment and removal was completed by
incubation in NH3 (specific gravity 0.88) overnight at 45°. The
didehydro derivative was reduced to the dideoxy derivative (8)
and converted to the triphosphate as for the ddATP. The monophosphate
was purified by fractionation on a DEAE-Sephadex
column using a triethylamine carbonate gradient
(0.025-0.3 M) but the triphosphate was not purified.
ddCTP was prepared from N-anisoyl-5'-O-monomethoxytrityldeoxycytidine
(Collaborative Research Inc., Waltham,
MA) by the above method but the final purification on
DEAE-Sephadex was omitted because the yield was very low
and the solution contained the required activity. The solution
was used directly in the experiments described in this paper.
An attempt was made to prepare the triphosphate of the
intermediate didehydrodideoxycytidine because Atkinson et

complementary strand of IX174 DNA. The inhibitors used were (left to right) ddGTP, ddATP, ddTTP, and araCTP. Electrophoresis was on
a 12%6 acrylamide gel at 40 mA for 14 hr. The top 10 cm of the gel is not shown. The DNA sequence is written from left to right and upwards beside
the corresponding bands on the radioautograph. The numbering is as given in ref. 2.

compounds seem much less stable than the dideoxy derivatives.

Sequencing Procedure. Restriction enzyme fragments were
obtained from OX174 replicative form and separated by electrophoresis
on acrylamide gels. The material obtained from 5
,ug of OX174 replicative form in 5 ,Al of H20 was mixed with
1 Al of viral or complementary strand 4X174 DNA (0.6 jg) and
1 Mi of H X 10 buffer (13) and sealed in a capillary tube, heated
to 1000 for 3 min, and then incubated at 670 for 30 min. The
solution was diluted to 20 Al with H buffer and 2 Al samples
were taken for each incubation and mixed with 2 Ml of the appropriate
"mix" and 1 il of DNA polymerase (according to
Klenow, Boehringer, Mannheim) (0.2 units). Each mix contained
1.5 X H buffer, 1 MCi of [a -32P]dATP (specific activity
approximately 100 mCi/,Mnwol) and the following other triphosphates.
ddT: 0.1 mM dGTP, 0.1 mM dCTP, 0.005 mM dTTP, 0.5
mM ddTTP
ddA: 0.1 mM dGTP, 0.1 mM dCTP, 0.1 mM dTTP, 0.5 mM

ddG: 0.1 mM dCTP, 0.1 mM dTTP, 0.005 mM dGTP, 0.5
mM ddGTP
ddC: 0.1 mM dGTP, 0.1 mM dTTP, 0.005 mM dCTP,
approximately 0.25 mM ddCTP
(The concentration of the ddCTP was uncertain because there
was insufficient yield to determine it, but the required dilution
of the solution was determined experimentally.)
araC: 0.1 mM dGTP, 0.1 mM dTTP, 0.005 mM dCTP, 12.5
mM araCTP
Incubation was at room temperature for 15 min. Then 1 Ml
of 0.5 mM dATP was added and incubation was continued for
a further 15 min. If this step (chase) was omitted some termination
at A residues occurred in all samples due to the low
concentration of the [a-32PldATP. With small primers, where
it was unnecessary to carry out a subsequent splitting (as in the
experiment shown in Fig. 1), the various reaction mixtures were
denatured directly and applied to the acrylamide gel for electrophoresis
(1). If further splitting was necessary (see Fig. 2),
1 Mil of the appropriate restriction enzyme was added shortly
after the dATP "chase, and incubation was at 370.
The single-site ribo-substitution procedure (N. L. Brown,
unpublished) was carried out as follows. The annealing of
template and primer was carried out as above but in "Mn
buffer" (66 mM TrisCl, pH 7.4/1.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol/

this and 1 unit DNA polymerase (Klenow) was added. Incubation
was for 30 min in ice. One microliter of 0.2 M EDTA was
added before loading on a 1-ml Sephadex G-100 column. Column
buffer was 5 mM Tris, pH 7.5/0.1 mnM EDTA. The labeled
fragment was followed by monitor, collected in a minimum
volume (approximately 200 Atl), dried down, and redissolved
in 30 ,.l of 1 X H buffer. Samples (2 Al) of this were taken

RESULTS
Figs. 1-3 show examples of the use of the method for determining
sequences in the DNA of OX174. In the experiment
shown in Fig. 1 two small restriction enzyme fragments (A12d
and A14, ref. 2) were used as primers on the complementary
strand and there was no final digestion step to cut between the

primer and the newly synthesized DNA. This is the most simple
and rapid procedure, requiring only a preliminary annealing
of template and primer, incubation of the four separate samples
with DNA polymerase and appropriate triphosphates, followed
by a chase with unlabeled dATP and application to the gel for
electrophoresis. In these experiments the inhibitors used were
ddGTP, ddATP, ddTTP, and araCTP. The conditions used for
the "T" samples were not entirely optimal, resulting in the
faster-moving bands being relatively weak.
The sequences can be read with reasonable accuracy starting
at 88 nucleotides from the 5' end of the primer for about 80
nucleotides (apart from some difficulty at position 3459 with
A12d). For the next 50 nucleotides there is some uncertainty
in the number of nucleotides in "runs" because bands are not
actually resolved.
With longer restriction enzyme fragments as primers it is
necessary to split them off from the newly synthesized DNA
chains before the electrophoresis. This is normally done by digestion
with a restriction enzyme. Fig. 2 shows such an experiment
in which fragment R4 was used as primer on the complementary
strand of OX174 DNA. In this experiment only
dideoxynucleoside triphosphates were used as inhibitors because
the results with araC were much less satisfactory when a restriction
enzyme was used for the subsequent splitting. This may
be due to the araC being removed by the 3'-exonuclease activity
of the DNA polymerase during the incubation at 370 (which
is necessary for the restriction enzyme splitting), resulting in
a few C bands being either very faint or missing. Alternatively,
the enzyme may be able to extend some chains beyond the araC
at the higher temperature while being unable to do so at lower
temperatures. araATP, which has been used only under these
conditions, shows the same limitations as araCTP. These
problems do not arise when ddCTP is used in this reaction.
With one exception (positions 4330-4343, see below), a sequence
of 120 nucleotides, starting at a position 61 nucleotides
from the restriction enzyme splitting site, could be read off; the
sequence agreed with the published one. This region is believed
to contain the origin of viral strand replication (2, 14). The
bands beyond position 4380 indicated that there was an error
in the provisional sequence (2), and further work (to be published
later) has shown that the trinucleotide C-G-C should be
inserted between positions 4380 and 4381.
When this technique is used the products are cut with a restriction
enzyme as above, difficulties arise if there is a second
restriction enzyme site close to the first one, because this will
give rise to a separate pattern of bands that is superimposed on
the normal one, making interpretation impossible. One way in
which this can be avoided is by the single-site ribo-substitution
method (N. L. Brown, unpublished). After annealing of the
template and primer a single ribonucleotide is incorporated by
incubation with DNA polymerase in the presence of manganese
and the appropriate ribonucleoside triphosphate. Extension of
the primer is then carried out with the separate inhibitors as
above and the primer is split off at the ribonucleotide by ribonuclease
or alkali. The method is particularly suitable for use
with fragments obtained with the restriction enzyme Alu,
which splits at the tetranucleotide sequence A-G-C-T. This
enzyme is in fact inhibited by single-stranded DNA and cannot
be used for the subsequent splitting of the primer from the
newly synthesized DNA chain. The initial incorporation is
carried out in the presence of rCTP and [a-32PldTTP. The incorporation
of the 32p facilitates subsequent purification on the
Sephadex column.
Fig. 3 shows an example of the use of this method with
fragment A8 on the viral strand of OX174 DNA. A sequence
of about 110 nucleotides starting 33 residues from the priming
site can be read off. In the provisional sequence (2) this region
was regarded as very tentative. Most of it is confirmed by this
experiment, but there is a clear revision required at positions
3524-3530. The sequence of the viral strand should read AT-C-A-A-C,
replacing A-T-T-C- - -A-C given in the provisional
sequence. There is difficulty in reading the sequence at
3543-3550, where there is considerable variation in the distance
between bands, suggesting the presence of a looped structure.
Further work in which the electrophoresis was carried out at
a higher temperature indicates that the sequence here is actually
G-C-T-C-G-C-G (viral strand); i.e., an insertion of C between
positions 3547 and 3548 in the provisional sequence.
DISCUSSION
The method described here has a number of advantages over
the plus and minus methods. First, it is simpler to perform because
it requires no preliminary extension, thus avoiding one
incubation and purification on a Sephadex column. It requires
only the commercially available DNA polymerase I (Klenow
fragment). The results appear to be more clear-cut with fewer
artefact bands, and can usually be read further than with the
plus and minus methods. Intermediate nucleotides in "runs"
show up as bands, thus avoiding a source of error in the plus and
minus method-estimating the number of nucleotides in a run.
Theoretically one would expect the different bands in a run to
be of the same strength, but this is not always the case. Frequently,
the first nucleotide is the strongest, but in the case of
ddCTP the second is the strongest (see Fig. 2). The reasons for
these effects are not understood, but they do not usually cause
difficulties with deducing the sequences. For the longer sequences
in which the separate bands in a run are not resolved,
experience has shown that it is frequently possible to estimate
the number of nucleotides from the strength and width of the
band.
The inhibitor method can also be used on a smaller scale than
the plus and minus method because better incorporation from
32P-labeled triphosphates is obtained. This is presumably due
to the longer incubation period used, which allows a more
quantitative extension of primer chains.
In general, sequences of from 15 to about 200 nucleotides
from the priming site can be determined with reasonable accuracy
using a single primer. Frequently it is possible to read
the gels further and, on occasions, a sequence of about 300
nucleotides from the priming site has been determined. Occasional
artefacts are observed, but these can usually be readily
identified. It seems likely that these are usually due to contaminants
in the fragments. The most serious difficulties are
due to "pile-ups" of bands, which are usually caused by the
DNA forming base-paired loops under the conditions of the
acrylamide gel electrophoresis. These pile-ups are seen as a
number of bands in the same position or unusually close to one
another on the electrophoresis. They generally occur at different
positions when the priming is carried in opposite directions
along the DNA over the same sequence. An example of
this effect is seen in Fig. 2 at position 4330, where there is a
single strong band in the G channel that in fact represents four
G residues. They are presumably forming a stable loop by
pairing with the four Cs at positions 4323-4326. Another example
is in Fig. 3 at positions 3545-3550. This effect is likely
to be found in all the rapid techniques that use gel electrophoresis.
It is felt that for an accurate determination of sequence one
should not rely completely on single results obtained by this
method alone but that confirmation should be obtained by some

other technique or by priming on the opposite strand. This
consideration probably applies to all other available methods
also. The main disadvantage of the present method is the difficulty
in obtaining all the inhibitors-particularly ddGTP,
which is not commercially available.
