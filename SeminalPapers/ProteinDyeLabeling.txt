A protein determination method which involves the binding of Coomassie
Brilliant Blue G-250 to protein is described. The binding of the dye to protein
causes a shift in the absorption maximum of the dye from 465 to 595 nm, and
it is the increase in absorption at 595 nm which is monitored. This assay is
very reproducible and rapid with the dye binding process virtually complete in
approximately 2 min with good color stability for 1 hr. There is little or no
interference from cations such as sodium or potassium nor from carbohydrates
such as sucrose. A small amount of color is developed in the presence of
strongly alkaline buffering agents, but the assay may be run accurately by the
use of proper buffer controls. The only components found to give excessive
interfering color in the assay are relatively large amounts of detergents such as
sodium dodecyl sulfate, Triton X-100, and commercial glassware detergents.
Interference by small amounts of detergent may be eliminated by the use of
proper controls.
Laboratory practice in protein purification often requires a rapid and
sensitive method for the quantitation of protein. Methods presently
available partially fulfill the requirement for this type of quantitation.
The standard Lowry procedure (1) is subject to interference by compounds
such as potassium ion (2), magnesium ion (3), EDTA (4), Tris
(3), thiol reagents (2), and carbohydrates (5). The relatively insensitive
biuret reaction (6) is subject to interference by Tris (7), ammonia (8),
and glycerol (9). Even the modified procedure for eliminating problems
with the Lowry and biuret assays (IO, 11) present problems since more
complications and time are involved in the modified procedures. The
dye binding techniques in the literature are for the most part insensitive
assays involving the binding of Orange G to protein (12- 16). The exception
to this rule is the Amidoschwarz 10-B binding assay (17). This
procedure, too, has its drawbacks since the precipitation of the protein
by trichloroacetic acid followed by filtration on Millipore membranes
is required.
The protein assay herein described eliminates most of the problems
involved in the procedures described above, and is easily utilized for

processing large numbers of samples, as well as adaptable to automation. It
is based on the observation that Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 exists
in two different color forms, red and blue (18). The red form is converted
to the blue form upon binding of the dye to protein (IS). The
protein-dye complex has a high extinction coefficient thus leading to great
sensitivity in measurement of the protein. The binding of the dye to protein
is a very rapid process (approximately 2 min), and the protein-dye
complex remains dispersed in solution for a relatively long time (approximately
1 hr), thus making the procedure very rapid and yet not requiring
critical timing for the assay.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents. Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 was obtained from Sigma,
and used as supplied. 2-Mercaptoethanol was obtained from Sigma.
Triton X- 100 was obtained from Schwartz/Mann. Sodium dodecyl sulfate
was obtained from BDH Chemicals Ltd., Poole, England. Hemosol was
obtained from Scientific Products. All other reagents were of analytical
grade or the best grade available.
Protein preparation. Bovine serum albumin (2x crystallized), chymotrypsinogen
A, and cytochrome c (horse heart) were obtained from
Schwartz/Mann. Hemoglobin and human serum albumin were obtained
from Nutritional Biochemicals Corporation. Protein solutions were prepared
in 0.15 M NaCl. Concentrations were determined for bovine serum
albumin, human serum albumin, chymotrypsinogen A, and cytochrome c
spectrophotometrically in a Bausch and Lomb Spectronic 200 uv
spectrophotometer based on E~~,,+z = 6.6 (19,20), 5.3 (19,21), 20 (19,22)
and 17.1 (23,24) respectively. Hemoglobin solutions were prepared
gravimetrically.
Preparation ofprotein reagent. Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (100 mg)
was dissolved in 50 ml 95% ethanol. To this solution 100 ml 85% (w/v)
phosphoric acid was added. The resulting solution was diluted to a final
volume of 1 liter. Final concentrations in the reagent were 0.01% (w/v)
Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, 4.7% (w/v) ethanol, and 8.5% (w/v)
phosphoric acid.
Protein assay (standard method). Protein solution containing 10 to
100 ,ug protein in a volume up to 0.1 ml was pipetted into 12 x 100 mm
test tubes. The volume in the test tube was adjusted to 0.1 ml with
appropriate buffer. Five milliliters of protein reagent was added to the
test tube and the contents mixed either by inversion or vortexing. The
absorbance at 595 nm was measured after 2 min and before 1 hr in 3 ml
cuvettes against a reagent blank prepared from 0.1 ml of the appropriate
buffer and 5 ml of protein reagent. The weight of protein was plotted
against the corresponding absorbance resulting in a standard curve used
to determine the protein in unknown samples.

Microprotein assay. Protein solution containing 1 to 10 pg protein in a
volume up to 0.1 ml was pipetted into 12 x 100 mm test tubes. The
volume of the test tubes was adjusted to 0.1 ml with the appropriate buffer.
One milliliter of protein reagent was added to the test tube and the contents
mixed as in the standard method. Absorbance at 595 nm was measured
as in the standard method except in 1 ml cuvettes against a reagent
blank prepared from 0.1 ml of the appropriate buffer and 1 ml of protein
reagent. Standard curves were prepared and used as in the standard
method.
RESULTS
Reproducibility, sensitivity, and linearity of the assay. Triplicate
standard assays of bovine serum albumin as a standard result in a highly
reproducible response pattern. Statistical analysis gives a standard deviation
of 1.2% of mean value for the assay. There is extreme sensitivity in
the assay with 25 ,ug sample giving an absorbance change of 0.275 OD
units. This corresponds to 5 pg protein/ml in the final assay volume.
There is a slight nonlinearity in the response pattern. The source of the
nonlinearity is in the reagent itself since there is an overlap in the spectrum
of the two different color forms of the dye. The background value for the
reagent is continually decreasing as more dye is bound to protein. This
presents no real problem since the degree of curvature is only slight. If
the assay is run with a set of standards and unknowns measured against
the response curve of the standards instead of calculated by Beer’s Law,
there is no difficulty in obtaining satisfactory results.
Accuracy of the assay. Figure 1 shows the results of various proteins
assayed in the system as to individual responses. There is a scattering of
points around the line drawn in the graph. The scattering is believed to be
a multifaceted function composed of difficulties in determining the exact
amount of protein present in a given sample due to variation of extinction
coefficients in the literature, the methods used to determine the exact
amount of protein used in measuring extinction coefficients, and some
degree of variation in the efficiency of dye binding to various proteins.
Figure 2 shows the response pattern obtained from Lowry (1) assays of the
same proteins. The degree of scatter in protein response to Lowry (1) assay
is similar to that shown for the dye-binding assay presented here. The
sensitivity of the Lowry (1) method is an absorbance of 0.110 OD units
for the 25 pg standard correspondi~ to 8 pg protei~ml of final assay
volume. By calculation, then, the dye binding assay is approximately
four times more sensitive than the Lowry (1) assay. The degree of scatter
around the Lowry (1) assay plot also points to the difficulty in establishing
a quantitative value for a protein in standard solutions.
Stability of the protein-dye complex color. Figure 3 shows the rate of

formation of protein-dye complex in the assay system and the stability
of the color complex. The absorbance was monitored at 7.5 set intervals
for 2 min and then at 1 min intervals for a period of 1 hr. As seen from
the graph, the color development is essentially complete at 2 min, and remains
stable plus or minus 4% for a period of 1 hr. Since the protein-dye
complex has a tendency to aggregate with time, there is a decrease in
color after this period of time simply by the physical removal of the
protein-dye complex from solution. If very precise determinations are
required, investigators should take precaution to read the absorbance of

samples during one of the flatter portions of the color stability curve between
5 and 20 min after reagent addition. This still gives ample time to
read a relatively large number of samples.
Microassay system sensitivity. When bovine serum albumin is used as
the standard in the micro assay system the degree of nonlinearity is
similar to that found in the standard assay. There is a loss in protein-dye
complex response as compared with the standard assay, i.e., 5 pg
protein/ml gives an absorbance change of 0.1 vs 0.27 in the standard assay.
Perhaps this results from increased dilution of the protein reagent.
Interference by nonprotein components. As indicated earlier, there is
some interference in the assay system by strongly alkaline buffering
agents. This may be overcome by running the appropriate buffer controls
and subtracting the value for the control either mathematically of
spectrophotometrically. A wide spectrum of components was tested for
effects on the protein dye binding assay (Table 1). A lack of effect on the
assay by magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium chloride,
ethanol, and ammonium sulfate was observed. The small effects due to
Tris, acetic acid, 2-mercaptoethanol, sucrose, glycerol, EDTA, and trace
quantities of the detergents, Triton X-100, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and
Hemosol, can be easily eliminated by running the proper buffer control
with the assay. However, the presence of large quantities of the detergents
present abnormalities too great to overcome.

A difficulty observed in performing the assay is the tendency of the
protein-dye complex in solution to bind to cuvettes. This results in a blue
colored cuvette. The amount of binding is negligible as far as assay readings
are concerned, i.e., less than 1% error, as indicated by the standard
deviation of triplicate assays in the reproducibility section. The
blueness of the cuvettes after assay does present problems in other uses
of the cuvettes so the following directions for cleaning the blue complex
from cuvettes is included:
Method 1: Rinse cuvettes with concentrated glassware detergent,
followed by water and acetone. (Gives immediate removal.)
Method 2: Soak cuvettes in 0.1 M HCL. (Removes complex in a
few hours.)
The binding of the protein-dye complex has been observed only with
quartz cuvettes and may be eliminated by using either glass or plastic
cuvettes.
