Guanidinium thiocyanate and chloride
are among the most effective protein denaturants
(1,2). As a strong inhibitor of ribonucleases,
guanidinium chloride was first introduced
as a deproteinization agent for isolation
of RNA by Cox (3). Since then
guanidinium extraction has become the
method of choice for RNA purification, replacing
phenol extraction. Guanidinium
methods have been used successfully by
Chirgwin et al. (4) to isolate undegraded
RNA from ribonuclease-rich tissues like pancreas.
Chirgwin’s protocol for ultracentrifugation
of a guanidinium thiocyanate lysate
through a CsCl cushion has become one of
the most frequently used for isolation of undegraded
RNA. In the present report, a new
rapid procedure combining guanidinium
thiocyanate and phenol-chloroform extraction
is described. A combination of guanidinium
and hot phenol for RNA isolation
has been reported by Feramisco et al. (5).
The method we describe differs in that it
converts the guanidinium-hot phenol
method to a single-step extraction which

Ave., Rm. 5564, Cincinnati, OH 45267-0547.
allows isolation of RNA in 4 h and provides
both high yield and purity of undegraded
RNA preparations. By eliminating the ultracentrifugation
step of the guanidinium-CsCl
method this procedure allows the simultaneous
processing of a large number of samples.
In addition, this new procedure permits
recovery of total RNA from small quantities
of tissue or cells making it suitable for gene
expression studies for which only a limited
quantity of biological material is available.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents. The denaturing solution (solution
D) was 4 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 25
mM sodium citrate, pH 7; 0.5% sarcosyl, 0.1
M 2-mercaptoethanol. To minimize handling
of guanidinium thiocyanate (hazardous)
a stock solution was prepared as follows:
250 g guanidinium thiocyanate (Fluka) was
dissolved in the manufacturer’s bottle (without
weighing) with 293 ml water, 17.6 ml
0.75 M sodium citrate, pH 7, and 26.4 ml
10% sarcosyl at 65°C. This stock solution
can be stored at least 3 months at room temperature.
Solution D was prepared by adding

solution. This solution can be stored 1
month at room temperature.
Phenol (nucleic acid grade, Bethesda Research
Laboratory) saturated with water was
kept at 4°C up to 1 month.
Small-scale RNA preparations were carried
out in 4- or 15-ml disposable polypropylene
tubes (Falcon, Cat. Nos. 2063,2059).
Experimental procedure. The acid guanidinium
- phenol - chloroform (AGPC)’
method was used to isolate RNA from both
tissues and cultured cells. The following protocol
describes isolation of RNA from 100
mg of rat mammary tissue.
Immediately after removal from the animal,
the tissue was minced on ice and homogenized
(at room temperature) with 1 ml
of solution D in a glass-Teflon homogenizer
and subsequently transferred to a 4-ml polypropylene
tube. Sequentially, 0.1 ml of 2 M
sodium acetate, pH 4, 1 ml of phenol (water
saturated), and 0.2 ml of chloroform-isoamyl
alcohol mixture (49:l) were added to
the homogenate, with thorough mixing by
inversion after the addition of each reagent.
The final suspension was shaken vigorously
for 10 s and cooled on ice for 15 min. Samples
were centrifuged at 10,OOOg for 20 min
at 4°C. After centrifugation, RNA was
present in the aqueous phase whereas DNA
and proteins were present in the interphase
and phenol phase. The aqueous phase was
transferred to a fresh tube, mixed with 1 ml
of isopropanol, and then placed at -20°C for
at least 1 h to precipitate RNA. Sedimentation
at 10,OOOg for 20 min was again performed
and the resulting RNA pellet was
dissolved in 0.3 ml of solution D, transferred
into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube, and precipitated
with 1 vol of isopropanol at -20°C for
1 h. After centrifugation in an Eppendorf
centrifuge for 10 min at 4°C the RNA pellet
was resuspended in 75% ethanol, sedimented,
vacuum dried (15 min), and dis-

solved in 50 ~10.5% SDS at 65°C for 10 min.
At this point the RNA preparation could be
used for poly(A)+ selection by oligo(dT)
chromatography, Northern blot analysis,
and dot blot hybridization. Isopropanol precipitation
can be replaced by precipitation
with a double volume of ethanol.
The protocol for RNA isolation by the
AGPC method is outlined in Table 1. Until
the last step, ribonuclease is inhibited by the
presence of 4 M guanidinium. Therefore no
additional precaution is required to protect
RNA from degradation. The final RNA
preparation can be dissolved in water or in
1 IIIM EDTA, pH 8, solution, treated with
diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEP) (6). We recommend,
however, to use 0.5% SDS (DEP
treated) which is a weak inhibitor of ribonuclease
and may diminish the effect of accidental
contaminations during the further use
and storage of RNA samples.
The AGPC method was used for both
small scale (3 mg tissue or lo6 cells) and large
scale (30 g tissue) RNA preparations. The
method was also used to isolate RNA from
cultured cell lines: human and mouse hematopoietic
cell lines, breast MCF-7 cells,
human normal lymphocytes, and bone marrow
blasts, and rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells.
RNA could be isolated from cells grown in
suspension (100 ~1 of solution D per lo6
cells) or in monolayer. Cells grown in monolayer
were lysed directly in the tissue culture
dish by the addition of denaturing solution
(1.8 ml of solution D for lo-cm-diameter tissue
culture dish).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
RNA was prepared from rat mammary
tissue by the AGPC extraction and compared
with RNA isolated in parallel by ultracentrifugation
of guanidinium lysate through
a CsCl cushion (4). Data in Table 2 show that
RNA isolated by the AGPC method contained
less contaminating proteins, as judged
by the 260/280 ratio, than RNA isolated by
the guanidinium-CsCl method. An additional
wash with 75% ethanol of the RNA
pellet during the AGPC extraction increased
to about 2 the 260/280 ratio of the isolated
RNA preparation. DNA was undetectable in
both preparations using Burton’s method
and both had a similar content of 25K casein
mRNA. The AGPC extraction, however, resulted
in a slightly higher yield of RNA.
Agarose-gel resolution patterns of total
RNA isolated from rat mammary gland and
rat liver by both the AGPC and the guanidinium-CsCl
methods are shown in Fig. 1.
Both preparations reveal similar patterns,
but liver RNA isolated by the AGPC method
contained a greater amount of low-molecular-weight
RNA (4-5 S).
The AGPC procedure was used for expression
studies of the ets-2 gene (9) in human
bone marrow myeloblasts (low-abundancy
mRNA), the 25K casein gene (10) in rat
mammary gland, and the thyroglobulin gene
(11) in FRTL-5 cells (high-abundancy
mRNAs). AGPC extracted RNA from
human myeloblasts was subjected to
oligo(dT) chromatography, and the poly(A)+
fraction was analyzed for ets-2 mRNA content
by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2A).
Three transcripts of 4.7, 3.4, and 2.8 kb were
detected by an ets-2 human genomic probe
(9) as previously observed using the guanidinium-CsCl
method. Total RNA isolated
from mammary explants cultured with a lactogenic
hormone combination (insulin, prolactin,
and hydrocortisone) were probed with
25K casein cDNA and B-actin cDNA (12)

FIG. 2. Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated by the
AGPC method. (A) Total RNA from human myeloblasts
was chromatographed on oligo(dT) column (15)
and 2 pg of the poly(A)+ fraction was analyzed for ets-2
mRNAs (4.7, 3.4, and 2.8 kb); (B) 1.5 r*g of total RNA
from rat mammary explants was analyzed for 2SK casein
mRNA (1.3 kb) and @actin mRNA (1.9 kb); (C) 1.6
r.rg of total RNA from rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells was analyzed
for thyroglobulin mRNA (8.9 kb) and fi-actin
mRNA. RNA preparations were electrophoresed, transferred
to Gene Screen Plus membrane, and autoradiographed
as described (9,12).
(Fig. 2B). A 1.3-kb casein mRNA and 1.9-kb
/3-actin mRNA were detected. Both messengers
migrated as distinct bands with no signs
of degradation. Thus, despite a high level of
ribonuclease activities in rat mammary tissue
( 13,14), the AGPC method assured high
quality of isolated mammary RNA. Finally,
undegraded high-molecular-weight thyroglobulin
mRNA (8.9 kb) could be visualized
in total RNA from rat FRTL-5 cells using a
rat thyroglobulin cDNA probe (11) (Fig. 2C).
Presented results show that the AGPC
method is a useful alternative to the previously
described methods of RNA isolation.
The AGPC extraction provides high yield
and the extracted RNA is both pure and undegraded.
Due to its simplicity and the elimination
of ultracentrifugation, the AGPC
method allows simultaneous processing of a
large number of samples. The method
proved to be particularly useful for RNA
isolation from as few as lo6 cells or 3 mg of
tissue (human pituitary tumor). The degradation
and loss of RNA is minimized by the
limited handling involved in this technique.
The AGPC method may therefore be useful
for clinical investigations that employ gene
expression such as protooncogene expression
as a molecular marker of malignancy and
tumor progression.
