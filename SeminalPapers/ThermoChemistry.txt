Despite the remarkable thermochemical accuracy of Kohn-Sham density-functional theories
with gradient corrections for exchange-correlation [see, for example, A. D. Becke, J.
Chem. Phys. 96, 2155 (1992)], we believe that further improvements are unlikely unless exactexchange
information is considered~ Arguments. to support this view are presenteo, and a
semiempirical exchange-correlation functional containing local-spin-density, gradient, and
exact-exchange terms is tested on 56 atomization energies, 42 ionization potentials, 8
proton affinities, and 10 total atomic energies of first- and second-row systems. This functional
performs significantly better than previous functionals with gradient corrections only,
and fits experimental atomization energies with an impressively small average absolute·
deviation of 2.4 kcal/mol.
I. INTRODUCTION
This is the third in a series of papers on the assessment
of density-functional theory (DFT) on the atoms and molecules
of the Gaussian-l (G 1) database of Pople and coworkers.
1.2 In the first paper,3 hereafter referred to as paper
I, we demonstrated that the well-known overbinding tendency
of the local-spin-density exchange-correlation approximation
(LSDA) is nicely compensated by the
exchange-only density-gradient correction of Becke.4 Our
second papers (paper II) indicated that the exchange-only
gradient correction by it:;;elf gives extremely poor ionization
potentials, and must be accompanied by a gradient
correction for dynamical correlation if a generally reliable
thermochemical procedure is desired. For this purpose, we
adopted the gradient-corrected correlation functional of
Perdew and Wang.6
Motivated by a reexamination of the adiabatic connection
formula for exchange-correlation energy,7 we have
also recently investigated8 a novel "half-and-half" mixing
of exact-exchange energy and the LSDA for exchangecorrelation
potential energy which performs as well on the
G I thermochemical tests as the gradient-corrected DFT of
paper II. We found, in addition, that a simple twoparameter
semiempirical generalization8 accurately fits the
G 1 data, for atomization only, with an average absolute
deviation from experiment of 2.6 kcal/mol, thus offering a
tantalizing hint of the future potential of this approach.
Unfortunately, our half-and-half theory of Ref. 8 is
defective in several respects. Though energy differences of
thermochemical interest are well obtained, total energies
are rather poor. The uniform electron-gas limit is not obtained,
a disturbing failure from a formal densityfunctional
perspective. Also, our semiempirical generalization
gives good atomization energies only, while ionization
potentials and proton affinities are extremely poor. In the
present work, we address these problems by incorporating
the gradient corrections for exchange and correlation examined
in papers I and II into our exact-exchange-IocalDFT
approach. With the added flexibility of gradient correction
terms, an impressive overall fit to G 1 thermochemical
data, total atomic energies, and even the uniform
electron gas is achieved.
A review of the Kohn-Sham DFT formalism, on
which this work is based, was presented in paper I and will
not be repeated here. Excellent expositions of densityfunctional
theory in general are also available elsewhere.9
Instead, we begin the following section with a discussion of
the adiabatic connection formula7 and its physical content.
The most important implication of this discussion is the
undeniable role of exact exchange. Despite the wellintentioned
efforts of density-functional researchers to circumvent
the calculation of exact-exchange energies, we
shall see that a small exact-exchange component is a natural
and necessary constituent of any exchange-correlation
approximation aiming for accurate molecular energetics.
II. THE ADIABATIC CONNECTION
The exchange-correlation energy Exc of Kohn-Sham
density-functional theory is given by a rigorous ab initio
formula known as the "adiabatic connection" formula.7 Of
the many possible forms that this important result may
take, the following is most convenient for our purposes:
Exc= fol U~c dA, (1)
where A is an interelectronic coupling-strength parameter
that "switches on" the lIrl2 Coulomb repulsion between
electrons, and U~c is the potential energy of exchangecorrelation
at intermediate coupling strength A. This formula
"connects" the noninteracting Kohn-Sham reference
system (defined by A = 0) to the fully interacting real system
(A = 1) through a continuum of partially interacting
systems (O<A<l), all of which share a common density p
(the density of the real, fully interacting system). Though
the integrand of Eg. (1) refers explicitly to potential energy
only, the kinetic part of the exchange-correlation energy is
generated, in effect, by the A integration. A simple derivation
of this adiabatic connection formula using first-order
perturbation theory may be found in the Appendix of Ref.
10.

Axel D. Becke: Density-functional thermochemistry. III 5649
We believe that careful consideration of the A dependence
of the integrand in Eq. (1) is important in understanding
the successes and failures of current densityfunctional
theories. In particular, the A=O lower limit,
corresponding to the noninteracting Kohn-Sham reference
system, is of major relevance. Here, the exchangecorrelation
potential energy rfxc is the pure exchange en-'
ergy of the Slater determinant of the Kohn-Sham orbitals,
with no dynamical correlation whatsoever. This KohnSham
exchange energy will be designated Ex from now on,
and is essentially, though not exactly, equal in value to the
conventional Hartree-Fock exchange energy. We refer the
reader to Ref. 8 and references therein for further discussion
of this point.
The conventional exchange-correlation LSDA substitutes
for each U~c in Eq. (1) a model value from local
uniform-electron-gas theory. Unfortunately, the local
electron-gas model is physically inappropriate near the
..1,=0 exchange-only limit in molecular bonds. The problem
may be understood by considering, for the sake of argument,
H2• In this simplest conceivable case, the exact (restricted)
exchange hole is the negative of the ug orbital
density and is reference-point independent. This static
hole, uniformly distributed over both centers, implies a
complete absence of left-right correlation in the H2 bond.
The electron-gas model hole, on the other hand, is
reference-point centered, relatively localized, and thus
"follows" its reference electron around. The effect is a
crude simulation of left-right correlation which, though
desirable in the interacting system, clearly misrepresents
the noninteracting ..1,=0 limit. Consequently, we believe
that the principal source of the overbinding error of the
LSDA is the ..1,=0 end of the coupling-strength integration.
Furthermore, Gunnarsson and Jonesll have argued
convincingly that density-functional energy differences suffer
conspicuous errors if orbital nodes are created or lost in
the process (e.g., antibonding orbitals). The intricacies of
exact-exchange-energy differences corresponding to
changes in orbital nodality are particularly poorly described
by local electron-gas models. Again, the problem is
most acute at A=O.
These arguments apply to density-functional exchange-correlation
approximations with gradient corrections
as well. We therefore suspect that gradient-corrected
DFT, no matter how sophisticated and no matter how well
atomic total energies are reproduced, will always display at
least slight overbinding tendencies. Indeed, perusal of the
atomization energy data in paper II reveals a distinct
overbinding tendency for the non hydride systems, though
hydrides are well treated.
Our "half-and-half" theory of Ref. 8 approximates Eq.
(1) as the average of the exact-exchange energy at ..1,=0
and the LSDA for exchange-correlation potential energy at
A= 1. Thus, we employ the electron-gas model at full interaction
strength only, and discard its problematic ..1,=0
limit altogether. This approximation performs quite well
on the thermochemical tests of the Gl database (average
absolute deviation of 6.5 kcal/mbl and maximum deviation
of -22.5 kcal/mol for atomization energies) and, indeed,
rivals the gradient-corrected DFT of paper II (average
absolute deviation of 5.7 kcal/mol and maximum deviation
of + 18.4). In the following section, we extend the work of
Ref. 8 by relaxing the linear A dependence underlying the
half-and-half model, and by including gradient corrections.
III. THE PRESENT MODEL
To reiterate the arguments of the preceding section:
theA=O limit of the coupling-strength integration of Eq.
( 1) is nothing more and nothing less than exact exchange.
Surely, therefore, exact exchange energy must playa role
in highly accurate density-functional theories. Accordingly,
we propose the following exchange-correlation approximation:

Exc= EiWA +ao (E:}act - E~SDA) + a x11E~88
+a ll.EPW91
C C ' (2)
where ao, ax, and ac are semiempirical coefficients to be
determined by an appropriate fit to experimental data,
cpct is the exact exchange energy, I1E~88 is Becke's 1988
gradient correction (to the LSDA) for exchange,4 and
I1E~W91 is the 1991 gradient correction for correlation of
Perdew and Wang.6 These are the same gradient corrections
considered in papers I and II. For the correlation
component of the leading term E~~A, we use the e1ectrongas
parametrization of Ref. 12.
Equation (2) is motivated by reasonable physical arguments.
The second term replaces some electron-gas exchange
with exact exchange to capture the proper small-A
limit of Eq. (1). The coefficient ao thus reflects the relative
importance of a system's independent-particle character,
or, equivalently, the rate of onset of correlation as A increases
from zero. We assume as a first approximation in
this work, that its value is constant. The third and fourth
terms allow optimum admixtures of exchange and
correlation-type gradient corrections. Clearly, the coefficient
a x has value less than unity, since the presence of the
Clact term reduces the need for the gradient correction
I1E~88. For good measure, we allow flexibility in the coefficient
ac as well. Notice, also, that Eq. (2) is the simplest
possible mixture of exact exchange, the LSDA for
exchange-correlation, and gradient corrections of exchange
and correlation type, that exactly recovers the uniform
electron-gas limit.
This functional has been applied to the atoms and molecules
of the G 1 database, following exactly the same basisset-free,
post-LSDA computational procedure as in papers
I and II and in Ref. 8. We refer the interested reader to
these previous publications for descriptions of the methodology.
The semiempirical coefficients of Eq. (2) have been
determined by a linear least-squares fit to the 56 atomizaJ.

and the overall root-mean-square deviation from experiment
for the complete set of 116 data points is 3.35 kcal/
mol.
We omit electron affinities from consideration here because
the LSDA exchange-correlation potential does not
bind negative ions, a well-known failure of the local-spindensity
approximation. Anions must therefore be stabilized
by Watson-sphere-like potentials in the present post-LSDA
framework, and, given the somewhat arbitrary nature of
such stabilizing potentials, we choose not to include electron
affinities in this work.
In Tables I-IV, we list all atomization energies, ionization
potentials, proton affinities, and total atomic energies,
respectively, of the present tests. Tables V and VI
summarize average absolute and maximum deviations. For
energies of atomization, the results of our optimized Eq.
(2) have an average absolute deviation from experiment of
only 2.4 kcal/mol, and a maximum deviation of 7.6. This is
less than half the error of the gradient-corrected DFT of
paper II (5.7 kcal/mol average), and only twice the error
of the Gaussian-2 theory of Pople and co-workers14 (1.2
kcal/mol average13). We concede, however, that the
present results are generated by a three-parameter leastsquares
fit, and therefore represent the best possible performance
of this class of exchange-correlation functionals.
For ionization potentials, our average absolute deviation
is 0.14 eV, compared with 0.15 in paper II and 0.05 for
Gaussian-2. 13 Our proton affinities have an average deviation
of only 1.2 kcal/mol, compared with 1.5 in paper II
and 1.0 for Gaussian-2. 13 Maximum deviations are listed in

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
We have revealed in this work the important and potentially
powerful role of exact exchange in densityfunctional
thermochemistry. The semiempirical combination
of exact exchange, the LSDA, and gradient correction
terms in Eq. (2) performs significantly better than the
gradient-corrected exchange-correlation functional of paper
II (Ref. 5), and approaches an average precision of
order 2 kcal/mol (or 0.1 eV, 10 kJ/mol). This is the accuracy
considered by Pople and co-workers! as a desirable
target for quantum thermochemical methods, and which is
comfortably met by the composite ab initio Gaussian-2
procedure. 14 The same target accuracy now appears realistic
for density-functional theory.
In future studies, we hope to eliminate the semiempirical
aspects of the present model through detailed analysis
of A dependence in the adiabatic connection formula, or
perhaps through insights from perturbation theory. Given
the encouraging level of precision achieved here, we feel
that the extra computational effort (for some!) of exactexchange
evaluation is well rewarded.
