A correlation-energy formula due to Colle and Salvetti [Theor. Chim. Acta 3'7, 329 (1975)], in
which the correlation energy density is expressed in terms of the electron density and a Laplacian
of the second-order Hartree-Fock density matrix, is restated as a formula involving the density
and local kinetic-energy density. On insertion of gradient expansions for the 1ocal kinetic-energy
density, density-functional formulas for the correlation energy and correlation potential are then
obtained. Through numerical calculations on a number of atoms, positive ions, and molecules, of
both open- and closed-shell type, it is demonstrated that these formulas, like the original ColleSalvetti
formulas, give correlation energies within a few percent.
I. INTRODUCTION
Interest in calculation of the correlation energy continues unabated.
'
%e here report a new development, in
which the Colle-Salvetti formula for calculating correlation energy from the Hartree-Fock second-order density matrix
is converted into a density-functional formula.
Let p(r) be the Hartree-Fock electron density and p2 "(r,,r2) be the diagonal element of the second-order HartreeFock
reduced density matrix,
HF N(N —1) 2
(ri~ir2~2 ) I «1«2 d~tv«3dr4 «x
p2" can also be expressed in terms of interparticle coordinates, p2 "(r,s), where
ri+r2 f
2
, s=r, —r2 .
The Colle-Salvetti formula for correlation energy then is
r
P2 "(r,r) 1+bP(r) [V,Pz "(r,s)], oexP[ —cP '~ (r)]
p(r) 1+dp(r)
(2)
where a =0.049 18„b=0.132, c =0.2533, and d =0.349.
This formula was arrived at by Colle and Salvetti by a
theoretical analysis accompanied by a series of approximations,
beginning (essentially) from the reasonable proposition
that the second-order density matrix including
correlation may approximated by the Hartree-Pock
second-order density matrix times a correlation factor.
The constants a, b, c, and d in the final formula were obtained
by a f][tting procedure using only the HartreeFock
orbital for the hehum atom. Colle and Salvetti
demonstrated that Eq. (3) gave good predicted correlation
energies for atoms and molecules. They also provided
and tested a generalized form for open-shell systems.
Here we carry on the analysis of Eq. (3) itself.

First consider a closed-shell atom or molecule, having
an even number of electrons. Then
P2 (rl r2)= P(rl)P(r2) Pl (rl r2)P1 (r2 rl) (4)

interparticle coordinates of Eq. (2), (4) reads

and there follows

Results of calculations with this formula are given in
Table I. For atoms, Clementi wave functions were
used; for molecules, wave functions of Snyder and
Basch. These are in complete agreement with the results
of Colle and Salvetti, as they should be since Eq.
(10) follows directly from Eq. (3).
Consider next a system in a state described by a general
single determinant, in which the a-spin electron
density difFers from the P-spin electron density. (In the
open-shell restricted Hartree-Fock case, which here is
our primary concern, the a-spin orbitals are the same as
the P-spin orbitals in the closed-shell part, but an excess
of lx- or p-spin orbitals in the rest. ) Equation (4} is replaced
by
p2 "(r1,r2) =-,'p(rl )p(r, )
so that
p,""(r,r)= —, 'p'(r) ——, '[p',(r)+pp(r)], (12)

Eq. (7) is replaced by
[V,P2 "(r,s)], 0——2[p (r)tHF(r)+ptl(r)t~HF(r)
where p (r) and ptl(r) are the a-spin and p-spin electron

Again numerical results obtained from the formula are
very good; see Table I.
III. GRADIENT EXPANSION FGRMUI.AS
Equations (10) and (15) lack of being pure density
functionals only because of the appearance in them of
the Hartree-Pock local kinetic-energy densities tHF, tHF,
and t HF, which depend on individual orbital densities. If
the view is adopted that the orbitals are the Kohn-Sham
orbitals, then these quantities too are functionals of the
density, and Eqs. (10) and (15) are pure densityfunctional
expressions [as would be Eq. (3) with this interpretation].
Eschewing that view for the present„one
can turn Eqs. (10) and (15) into explicit densitytT„(r)=C~P(r)'i,
C~= —, ', (3n )

In terms of this, the conventional closed-shell gradient
expansion of tHF gives, to zero order,
to second order,
tHF(r)=tTF(r)+[ —, 'tg (r)+ —,', V' p],

functional formulas by using gradient expansions„whereby
t HF is expanded about the Thomas-Fermi local
kinetic-energy density tTF.
The Thomas-Fermi kinetic-energy density is given by

and so on. An alternative formula is provided by the
mean-path approximation, to zero order,
tH„(r)=tTF(r)+[ ,
'tn—(r) ——,
', V' p] .
For the open-shell case, the corresponding formulas are
readily derived using"
t „(r)=-,'t „(2p (r),r),
t~H„(r) = —, 'tH„(2ptt{r), r) .
The correlation energy formulas of Eqs. (10) and (15)
then become

As written, these are conventional second-order gradient expansion formulas, for closed and open shells, respectively.
The zero-order formulas are obtained by striking out the terms within the parentheses in each case. The zero-order
mean-path formula is obtained by replacing —,', with ——,', in these terms.
Table I gives numerical results obtained from these formulas. The second-order gradient formulas are hardly distinguishable
from the original Eqs. (10) and (15) and provide excellent representations of actual correlation energies. The
conventional zero-order gradient formula and the zero-order mean-path formula are not quite as good.

Table II gives detailed comparisons with other
mcthocls (extending a sllllllal table 111 Rcf. 2). Thc
present second-order gradient expansion is seen to be not
only an excellent approximation to the Colle-Salvetti formula,
but at least as good as the other extant densityfunctional
formulas. Also, there is a considerable computational
advantage of the present formulas. The resultant
Kohn-Sham exchange potentials contain no terms
including the computationally awkward V'

.
The good numerical accuracy of the Colle-Salvetti formula,
incorporating as it does only data on helium and
theoretical arguments, commends it for further improvement
and analysis. The predictive power can be improved
by reparametrization using data on more systems.
(Note for example that multiplying the parameter
a by —"
,
greatly improves the zero-order results. ) Also it
may prove possible to correct for the deficiencies in the
derivation.
